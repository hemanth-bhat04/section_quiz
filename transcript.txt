Yes. Okay. Today, in the afternoon, you will have a discussion session. Okay? They will ask you to share your screen and execute the code. Okay? So, Shilpa ma’am will be taking it today in the afternoon. Shilpa ma’am will take it at 4:00 p.m. So, what about the tool—is it comfortable? Oh, working on that, ma’am. No, that tool—is it comfortable? Means, do… Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

In that case, yes, we cannot open another tab, ma'am. Actually, it shows us an additional tab. If a designer is working on it, we have to focus on that. If you try to open another one, it should show an error. Opening another tab means you want to add a file, or I’ll add it while compiling. Ma’am, the history will still be there, and it will continue executing for the other one. Yes, ma’am, like the previous one will be executed. I think we have to separate them because they are not using the specific instance, so there’s no need for that. That’s why you’re getting the error. The design tab we are unable to close—it can’t be closed. So, you don’t need to create a new design and open it. Instead, you have to go to the right side and click it. A new window will start opening. In that case, they are executing it, which is why they are getting the issue.

--- 

Let me know if you need further adjustments! Just a minute. Okay. If you’ve written the code like this, then if you want to open a new one, you have to click on the “Start a New Playground” option on the left side. And again, you’ll get a new one, and you have to write. So, for `design.sv`, you can’t close it if you want to add a new file to that one. Whichever file is there, you have to click the plus symbol. For the structural implementation, you'll need two additional files because some models will be included inside. At that point, the main code should be written in `design.sv`. Here, the plus symbol indicates that you need to create something. For example, if you've written about the full adder in `design.sv`, and the full adder uses a half adder, then you must click here and create a `.v` file. In this file, you should write the half adder code. You cannot close `design.sv` or `testbench.sv`, as those are fixed. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  

Regarding your approach: Creating a new tab for the next step is correct. They are using "new" instead of "design." Instead of using `design.sv`, I have used `instance` only. So, again, you are creating it like this. Yeah, yeah—that's what I didn't use the `design.sv`. You did not use this one: `design.sv`. Okay, so actually, now the tool will compile like this: First, it will go to `testbench.sv`. Inside that, it will check which model is there. Then it will go to the design. In the design, if you don't write anything, it will go to the next one. Usually, in the `design.sv`, you have to write the main code. The sub-codes you write by opening new tabs here. I think now it's clear. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Okay, so let us continue with the theory session. Today's assignment—I have asked you to enable. Today, you'll have an assignment based on the... Data flow modeling: Okay, so in the afternoon, you'll have a discussion of yesterday's assignment. Ma'am, yes, ma'am. Do we need to write the assignment on a notebook, or just here? I'm not able to hear you clearly, ma'am. I'm asking whether we need to write the assignment on a notebook or not. What you can do is take a picture of this, okay, and paste it into a Word document, then convert it to a PDF. For theory questions, I will just write the answers—like "1(a)" or "2(a)," and so on. Okay, okay, ma'am, ma'am. Thank you. Okay. You have to upload the assignments, okay. Okay. For the results, I want the waveform, along with the design code, test bench code, and the waveform in the assignments. Ma'am, when we download this file... We are getting a test batch, and you will get all the files, including `data_design.sv`. You will get these files when you download them. Do we also get the waveform? No, you won’t get the waveform window. So, we need to take screenshots of that already. You can take screenshots. No, ma’am. Mhmm. Okay, okay. Take a print screen or a screenshot and paste it into the Word document. Okay, ma’am. Okay. So, we’ll start with today’s class. Today, I will go through switch-level modeling, data-flow modeling, and operators. First, we’ll start with switch-level modeling. Switch-level modeling is implemented using transistors and is used to describe small-scale systems like AND gates, NAND gates, OR gates, and even multiplexers (MUX). You can use it for those. But for more complicated… It is very difficult to use switch-level modeling, so it is typically implemented at the VLSI circuit layer. This is the lowest HDL (Hardware Description Language) logic level description. After the switch level, the next level is the gate level, which is more commonly used. The switch level is rarely used, so we move on to the gate level. The gate level is followed by the structural level, then the data flow level, and finally, the behavioral level, which is the highest level. Let's take an inverter example. Here is an inverter. You may have encountered this diagram with transistors in your VLSI subjects. It consists of a PMOS and an NMOS. This is the inverter, with "in" as the input and "out" as the output. When writing the switch-level diagram, we include both the PMOS and NMOS. So, for the PMOS, we have VDD connected to the output, and for the NMOS, we have the input connected to the gate, ground connected to the source, and the output connected to the drain. So, here’s the breakdown: For the PMOS, VDD is the source, "in" (the input) is the gate, and "out" is the drain. For the NMOS, the source is grounded, "out" is the drain, and "in" is the gate. To understand this, you need to revisit the basics of VLSI design. If we connect a PMOS and an NMOS in series, whatever input we provide here will be inverted. This is the inverted logic diagram using a PMOS and an NMOS. Now, let's discuss how to write a Verilog code for this circuit. How we will write it is... So, we have a `module` keyword, then an `inverter` name, and we have `y` and `a` (or you can use any names). Here, `a` is the input, and `y` is the output. The naming has been changed, so now:  
- Input: `a`  
- Output: `y`  

According to the diagram, `in` is the input, and `out` is the output. In switch-level modeling, we have predefined words for power supply: `VDD` and `GND`. `VDD` represents a high voltage, so for that, we use a predefined term called `supply1`. `supply1` is a predefined word for the higher voltage, and `supply0` is a predefined word for the ground. Here, `supply1` represents `VDD`, and the name can be anything (e.g., `VSS`). However, `supply1` is predefined for high voltage, so we use `supply1` for `VDD`. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Just a minute—someone has logged in. Okay, so here we have a supply of one (VDD) and a supply of zero (ground). Then we have to write a PMOS and an NMOS. Okay, so it was like this, right? So, this is my NMOS, and this is my PMOS. This is ground, and this is my VDD. Okay, so here is my output. So, in this code, the output is taken as "y." Okay, and this is the input, so the input is taken as "a." Okay, so for the PMOS: okay, so the PMOS is already built-in. We just have to call the PMOS by its name, like your gate primitives. Then you have an instance.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Okay, so after the instance name, we have to specify the ports. Here, there’s an order: first, we have to give the drain, source, and gate. This is the order—first, you have to give the drain, source, and gate. For example, in the PMOS transistor, `y` is the drain, `VDD` is the source, and `a` is the gate. Similarly, for the NMOS transistor, the order is the same: first, drain, source, and gate. The NMOS keyword comes first, followed by the instance name. In this case, `y` is the drain, `ground` is the source, and `a` is the gate. Okay? So, in switch-level modeling, the order is important: drain, source, and gate. Like in primitive gate definitions, where the output should come first and inputs should follow, it’s similar here. Here's the corrected version of your text:

---

Switch-level modeling involves defining the order of components: drain, source, and gate. For the inverter using PMOS and NMOS transistors, we need to specify predefined words for the high voltage supply (VDD) and ground (GND). In this case, we have a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor. For the PMOS, Y is the drain, VDD is the source, and A is the gate. For the NMOS, N1 is the instance name, Y is the drain, GND is the source, and A is the gate. Once these connections are defined, we can complete the model.

Now, let’s create a testbench. First, we declare a module named `tb_inverter`, with a register `A` and a wire `Y`. Then, we instantiate the inverter as `N1`, connecting `Y` and `A`. In the simulation setup, we use `initial begin` to define the dump file (`dump.vcd`). We set `A` to 1 since it is a single-bit signal. As `A` is a single bit, we can directly assign its value.

--- 

This version maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and grammar. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments! You can assign `a` as `1` or `0`, but if it is a multiple-bit value, you need to define it explicitly, such as `2'b00`. For a single bit, you can write directly, like `a = 1` or `a = 0`, or use a format like `1'b0` or `1'b1`. However, for multiple bits, you cannot write directly; you must define them explicitly. For example, if it is a 2-bit value, you would write `2'b00` or `2'b11`. These are the values you need to specify. This is the testbench for the inverter. Any doubts? Yes, Prabhat Ma'am, just a little doubt: If I take the input as a vector form, like `[4 downto 0]`, what does "input in vector form" mean? You’re talking about the four-bit triple adder, ma’am. So, for the four-bit triple adder, you will draw it using switch-level modeling. Uh-huh. No, ma’am. Just a note: in the test bench, we have those connections. No, ma’am. This is what you’re referring to—the connections. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, if you take the input in vector form, we don’t need to use connections like `.a[0]` or `.b[0]`. No, no, no, no—nothing like that. For example, here, instead of using something like `.a[0]`, let’s consider another example. Let’s say `a` is declared as a vector from 0 to 3 (`a[0:3]`). So, you’ll declare it here as `a[0:3]`. Again, in the test bench, you’ll also define `a` as `a[0:3]`, right? Yeah, ma’am. So, the… When you're making the connection, there's no need to write the range directly. If you write just "a" in the brackets, that's enough. Actually, I didn't specify the range from 0 to 3 for "a." No, no, no—that's incorrect. That's good—it will give an error. Okay, yeah, ma'am—I'm getting errors. Yeah, that's fine. So, anyway, you've declared how many bits and specified the range. Yeah, ma'am. Yeah, ma'am—just make sure to do the port mappings correctly. Ma'am—but if I declare a range of 4 downto 3 in the design part and only specify "a" in the testbench, and then try something like `a.a[0]` or `a[0]` in the testbench, that won't work. Because the number of bits will mismatch. Either you'll get an error, or it will only take the single-bit value. Here's the corrected version of your text:

---

Okay. Either it will show an error or it will cause some issue. It will only take a single value, like the last MSB or LSB value. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Welcome. Again, who has raised their hand? Ma’am, yeah, Pankaj ma’am. In that testbench, in the case of switch-level modeling, we can only give 0 or 1. No, ma’am, we cannot give other values because PMOS or NMOS transistors depend on logic levels, so we must provide single values. Yes, ma’am, it’s at a very low level. Multi-bit inputs are not allowed. But if you want to write a diagram for multi-bit operations, like a ripple carry adder or similar, then, ma’am, I have to provide each input separately. Yes, you have to provide them separately.

--- 

Let me know if you need further refinements! Separately, you have to take the PMOS and NMOS. Yes, ma’am. That will be very complicated. Yes, yes, ma’am. So, for that reason, we say that switch-level modeling is at the lowest level. Mhmm. Yes, ma’am. Due to these reasons, we have different types of modeling. There are some drawbacks with these models, so we define different levels of modeling. Okay? So, if you have any doubts, please ask. If you understand, please take my guess. Okay? Next, I will show the diagram. I want you to tell me. Okay? Next, I have a two-input NAND gate. This is my NAND gate. Okay? So, when we are writing a NAND gate, we have a PMOS in parallel and an NMOS in series. Okay? So, here, we did it. These are the… The source and inputs **A** and **B** are the gates for the PMOS, and the output is the drain. In this NMOS configuration, the output is the drain, **A** is the gate, and **S1** is the source for the first NMOS. For the second NMOS, the ground is the source, **S1** becomes the drain, and **B** becomes the gate. In the PMOS, the source is **VDD**, and **A** and **B** are the gates, with the output serving as the drain. Since the NMOS transistors are in series, the output is the drain, **A** is the gate, **S1** acts as the source for the first NMOS, and for the second NMOS, **S1** becomes the drain, **B** becomes the gate, and the ground serves as the source. Now, let’s discuss how to write the code for this circuit. So... This is the code. So, in this one, I have a module called `nand_gate`. Here, I have defined the ports: `out`, `a`, and `b`. Then, I have declared the inputs as `a` and `b`, and the output as `out`. For the VDD and GND connections, I'm using `supply1` for VDD and `supply0` for GND. I have a signal named `s1` here, which is a wire connection between the NMOS transistors. So, `s1` is a wire.  

The order of declaration doesn't matter. Similar to the gate-level implementation, depending on the input changes, the components will activate accordingly. Similarly, at the switch level, the order doesn't matter—you can write the PMOS first, then the NMOS, or vice versa. However, the connections must be correct. The order (drain, source, gate) should be accurate.  

So, I have written the NMOS first. For `n1`, the first connection is the drain, which is connected to `s1`. This is the drain for `n1`, and this is...   So, sorry—this is **N1**, and this is **N2**. Okay. For **N1**, **S1** is the source, **ground** is the source, **b** is the gate, and the drain is **a**. So, the drain, source, and gate are defined. For **N2**, the next one, the drain is **out**, **S1** is the source, and **a** is the gate. Next, for the PMOS, the output is the drain, **VDD** is the source, and **a** and **b** are the gates. This configuration forms a NAND gate. If you want to write a NAND gate, you need to connect an inverter here. So, this will be your NMOS, and this is your PMOS. Here, it will be having... And this is a ground, so at that time, what will happen to the output (`out`)? It will become an intermediate signal. For that reason, we will declare `out` as a `wire`. We'll name it as a `wire` here. A `wire` is the output, so `out` will become a `wire`, along with `s1`. `s1` will also become a `wire`. This is the NAND gate. Here, the NAND gate along with one inverter will give you an AND gate. Again, in the AND gate, you have to add one more NMOS and one more PMOS in the code. This is a NAND gate. Can I explain both the NAND and AND gates? Next, I have no issues. Now, I want... Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

So, anyone, if you can answer this: We need two PMOS transistors and two NMOS transistors. Okay? On one side, in between, we are taking AP莫斯 and BP莫斯 as well. Okay? What do I have to declare here? Yes, ma’am. Okay. So, first, let me ask you about the first PMOS. For the first PMOS, the source is connected, okay? In between, so... so the drain is this one. Okay? First, what do I have to write: VDD or S1? S1, okay? So, this has to be S1. Okay?

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! After that, we did it. Yeah, okay. For the next PMOS, why? Why? Yes, `s1` is connected to `b`. So, in this case, `s1` will become the drain for the first NMOS. For the second PMOS, it will become the source. Okay. Now, what about the NMOS? The NMOS will have its source connected to ground (`VSS`). Yeah, okay. For the next time, it will become `VSS`. `VSS` and `VSS`—okay. So, I'll just show the code now. Here, the module is `not`. Get **Y**. **A** and **B** are the inputs, and the output is **Y**. Then, I have a supply (**VDD**) and ground. The connections are as follows: For the PMOS, **Y** is connected to **VDD**, and there is a wire labeled **s1** between them. For the NMOS, **Y** is connected to ground, **b** is connected to ground, and **a** is connected to ground. For the first PMOS, the connections are **s1**, **VDD**, and **a**. For the second PMOS, the connections are **Y**, **s1**, and **b**. For this circuit, we need to write a test bench and check the outputs. Okay, so let me go to the tool. Oh, God! So I will open the code here. Just a minute. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Okay, so I have examples here. So, in the inverter switch-level design, in the design, I have a module called `inverter` with inputs `y` and `a`. Then I have an input `a` and an output `y`. The supply is `vdd` for one and `ground` for zero. So, you can see the colors—it’s showing keywords in purple. Then I have a PMOS (`p_one`) with connections `y`, `vdd`, and `a`. For the NMOS, I have `n_one` with connections `y`, `ground`, and `a`. So, here I have a testbench for the inverter. In the testbench, the inverter is instantiated. Then I have an `initial` block where a dump file is created, and `dumpvars` is done. So, I’m giving values for `a` and `b`, and after some time, I’m displaying the results again.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! So, I'm assigning a value, adding some delay, and displaying the values. Then, I'm changing the value of `a` again and displaying it. Finally, I use `$finish` to end the simulation. When I run this, I encounter some errors. The issue is that I've referenced a variable named `b` in the test bench (`testbench.sv`), but that variable isn't defined. To fix this, I'll comment out the reference to `b`. After that, if I save the file and run it again, the error should be resolved. So, in the waveform, you’ll see the value of `a` and the value of `y`. When `a` is 0, `y` is 1. When `a` is 1, `y` is 0. Okay. When `a` is 0, `y` is 1. So, here in this case… just a minute—I’m talking, but I’m not able to [continue]. These things, okay. So here, if I change anything—okay. If I didn't give `supply1` again, and if I run it, Ma'am, what is the "waiting room"? What is in the "waiting room"? Okay, I'm not able to see here. Okay, yes, okay. So, if at all I miss something like `supply1`, again, it will tell me there is a problem with `VDD`. So, you have to give `supply1` here. Sometimes, you may miss this. If you give any other name, like instead of `ground`, if you give something like `zero` or something else, these things will show up. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Okay, so here, you have to properly give the names. And one more thing: Yesterday, I told you about the `$display` statement. If I don’t include the delay, okay? So, I’ll run this. You can see the first initial values. Someone has put something, ma’am, but there’s an issue. I’m leaving now. Okay, I’m not able to... just a minute. I’ll adjust the settings of the profile so that I can get the EP waveform in a separate window. It’s overlapping.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Okay, so I wanted to show you this. I will remove the waveform. Now, see here—the initial value of `y`. I did not give any delay here. Okay, I directly wrote the display statement. The value of `a` will show, but the `y` value—the updated output of the inverter—is showing `X` in the display. Okay, this is why—because there should be some delta time. Okay, so… Yeah, it needs some delta time to get updated. Okay? So, for that reason, we are giving some delays and then we are giving the display statements. Okay? So, you have to keep that in mind. This is the inverter code. Okay? Can you write the code for NAND and NOT gates? NAND and NOR? Yes, ma’am. Or, do you want me to show those things? We can do that, ma’am. I have a doubt. Yeah, test bench. Test bench. Okay. Yeah, you can ask anything, ma’am. Which one? How to create a test bench? Output? How to create a test bench? How to create the test bench? Yes, ma’am. So, how to create the test bench… Now, I will remove this part. So… Initially, it will be like this—you won’t have anything. So, what I’ll do is, regardless, `testbench.sv` will be fixed, so you have to start writing the code. For the inverter test bench, I’ll write `inverter_tb;`. The syntax we saw in the previous class is as follows: I have a `reg a`, then I have a `wire y`. Then, we have to instantiate the inverter from the design model. What I’ll do is `.y(y)` for the output connections, then `.a(a)` for the input connections, performing port mapping. After that, I’ll write `initial`, then `begin`, and I’ll use `$dumpfile` to get the waveform. I'm using these two lines, and then I have `$dumpvars`. Next, I'll assign a value to `a`. I can do this either by directly setting it (e.g., `a = 0`) or by using a tick format (e.g., `#1'b0`). As I proceed, I'll introduce delays and continue assigning values to `a`. This process is common for every code, but the number of input values depends on the number of inputs in the circuit. For an inverter, I have only one input, so I'm assigning values only to `a`. If I had a NAND gate with two inputs, I would also need to assign values to `b` (e.g., `b = 0` or `#1'b0`). Similarly, for initialization, I need to declare both `a` and `b` as `reg` variables (e.g., `reg a, b;`). Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Also, it will change `a` and `b`, and here, the port mapping will also change to `b.b`, ma’am. In the design, if you have any wire and it happens to be used in the testbench code, should it be declared as a `wire` or a `reg`? So, you mean you might need some other variables if it’s required in the testbench? Yes, yes, yeah—that will be written as a `reg`. Okay, okay. Sometimes, using loops, you might write something, but I told you: No `integer`. For a NAND gate, we’ll use `s1` as a `wire`, yeah, yeah. So, that will work. We’ll consider that. You’ll write only in the design part—in the design, you’ll...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Writing here via `yes_one` in the test bench—that is not a port, right? Yes, that’s not a port. It is not a port; it is the connection inside your code/design. So, only in the design will you declare `wire s_one`, but in the test bench, you won’t do anything here because the wire is driven by the gates. We won’t assign a value to that one. Okay, okay, okay. So, the `s_one` value will depend on this PMOS and the NMOS, right? Yeah, yeah. For that, we won’t give it in the inverter test bench. So, in the test bench, only the external ports are present. Now, for the design, we are giving values only for those ports. Ma’am, thank you. Yeah, so, is there anything else? Ma’am, in vector form, how will we give the inputs? Ma’am, if you’re having four bits, how will we give that? So here, I will define a 4-bit number from 3 down to 0. Okay, so when I’m giving a value for `a`, `a` will be equal to `4'b0001`. This is in binary. If you want to give it in decimal, `a` is equal to `5'd5`. Okay, so if you want to give it in hexadecimal, `a` equals `4'h4` or any value like that. If you want to give it in octal, `a` equals `4'o4` or any value. These are the different ways you can write it, but you have to define how many bits it is. Yeah, ma’am. Okay, so guys, understood? Any doubts? Yes, Ma'am. Yeah, I understood everything now. Okay, so for now, I want you to write about those NAND and NOR gates. Later, I will go further. Ma'am, yeah, hello. Yeah, Pankaj Ma'am, I want to ask something else. While I was running the program, it was showing an "implicit net declaration error." An "implicit net declaration error" so, for which variable, Ma'am? Actually, in the last question, I have one `f2`. In the last day's assignment, the assignment will take place in the afternoon. Okay, okay. So, if at all you're getting an "implicit wire" error, maybe some wire declaration is missing. No, I declared everything. I actually declared everything. And it is also running, and for some values, the function gives a "don't care" result, meaning the output is `X`. Output `X` means there might be an issue in the connections somewhere. Sometimes, you are assigning two values to the same wire. I'll show you; I'll show you in the evening, Ma'am. Okay, in the afternoon, we'll discuss the doubts and assignments. So, understood how to write the testbench? And in between, if you want to display something, you can use `$display` and `$finish`. How to use `$finish`? Okay, so we'll go back to the theory class. We'll start with the operators. So, in the assignment, you don't have any questions on the switch level. I want you guys to write for a NAND and NOR gate. And AND, OR… okay. Anyway, you know the diagrams, so you can write for AND, NOR, AND, OR. Okay, so in the assignment, those questions are not there. I want you to try for that switch-level modeling. Okay, so we’ll go back to the theory. We’ll start with the operators. So the operators—those are the… That will indicate which operation has to be done. Okay. So the operators are used to build the expressions and describe the behavior of the hardware. In Verilog, we have different types of operators. Here, we have logical operators, reduction operators, relational operators, shift operators, replication operators, bitwise operators, arithmetic operators, equality operators, concatenation operators, and conditional operators. These are the different operators, and we’ll see them one by one. First, I will go through the logical operators. The logical operators produce a single-bit value. After performing the operation, they give a single-bit value, which can be either 0 (false), 1 (true), or X (unknown). These are the symbols and operations, so… Double emphasis (`&&`) means logical AND, and double pipe (`||`) means logical OR. The tilde (`~`) represents negation. Okay? So, for these operations, logical AND and logical OR require two operands, while negation requires only one operand. We have an example here. In the logical operators, if I give a four-bit value, consider this example. Just a minute—I’ll admit someone. Okay? In this example, `a` is a four-bit value: `1101`, and `b` is `0000`. Okay? So, in the logical operators, it will check the values. What is the value of `a` in decimal? How much is it? Ten? Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen. It is… Okay, so what about `b`? It is 0. Before performing the operation, it will check the value of `a`. The value of `a` is 13. Since it is greater than 0, it will compare it with 0. Because it is greater than 0, it will convert it into a single bit. If it is greater than 0, it will treat it as true, which is 1. For `b`, since it is equal to 0, it will treat it as 0. So here, we have a true condition and a false condition. When I apply a logical AND, true AND false will result in false. If you’re working with single bits, there’s no problem. However, if the value is 4 bits, 5 bits, or more, it will check whether the value is greater than 0. If it is greater than 0, it will treat it as a true condition (1). If it is equal to 0, it will treat it as 0. So here, in… For the logical OR operation, I have `a = 1` because it is greater than zero. Then, I have `b = 0`, which is zero. It will perform the logical OR operation and give the result as `1`.  

Now, let me repeat the same explanation:  

You have a value for `a`: `1 1 0 1`. Here, the value of `a` is `13`. And the value for `b` is `0`. These values are compared with `0`. Since `13` is greater than `0`, it will convert the entire value into a single bit: `1`. If the value is greater than `0`, it will treat it as `1`; if it is equal to `0`, it will treat it as `0`.  

With this single bit, it will perform the logical operation. So, for `1 AND 0` (logical AND), `true AND false` will result in `false`, which is `0`.  

Similarly, for the OR operation... If I apply a logical OR, then true OR false will result in a true value. Ma’am, for the input `1101` and `0010`, the output will be `1`. If you have a different value instead of `0`, such as `0010` (which is 2), and it is greater than 0, it will treat it as a true condition. So, any value greater than 0 is treated as `1` itself. Okay, okay. If there are any unknown values in between, for example, if I have `1x01`, you don’t know the value of `x`. In this case, `x` is treated as `x`, and `0` remains `0`. Now, any operation involving `x` will result in `x`. If you need any bit in the vector… If it is `X`, it is considered an unknown value. Any operation involving an unknown value will result in an unknown outcome. Okay, so I have one more example here, which he asked. Here, `A` is `1101`, and `B` is `0010`. So, here, the result is `1` because if I perform an AND operation, it evaluates to true. Now, let’s consider negation. Next, we have negation of `A`. What about the value of `A`? It is `13`, which is greater than zero, so it becomes `1`. What about the negation of `A`? It is the inverse, so the output will be `0`, which is false. This is how logical operators work. Are there any doubts regarding these operators? Okay, I’ll move on to the next operator. The next is the **bitwise operator**. Bitwise operators are used to perform logical operations on individual bits. Unlike logical operators, which convert the entire operand into a single bit before performing the operation, bitwise operators operate on each bit individually. In bitwise operations, you have:

- **Bitwise AND**
- **Bitwise OR**
- **Bitwise NOT (negation)**
- **Bitwise XOR**
- **Bitwise XNOR**

Here’s an example:  
Let `A = 1101` and `B = 1100`. In bitwise operations, the operation is performed bit by bit across the vectors. So:

- `1 AND 0` gives `0`
- `1 AND 0` gives `0`
- `0 AND 0` gives `0`
- `1 AND 1` gives `1`

All the bits are used in the operation. Operation, okay. Similarly, for the logical OR, `1 1 0 1 | 1 1 0 0` means I will get `1 1 0 1`. If I take the negation of `a`, meaning `~1 1 0 1`, all the bits will be negated, so it will become `0 0 1 0`. This is called bitwise operation. You should not get confused—double ampersand (`&&`) is for logical AND, while single ampersand (`&`) is for bitwise AND. Okay, so, any doubts here? Please ask. And, yeah, in the input, if it is `1 1 X 1`, then what will be the output? `1 1 X 1`, okay. One more question? Input—I will take this input, okay, ma’am. Annotation is not seen. Annotation is not seen. Just a minute—no, yes, ma’am, I’ve seen it. No, okay. So, here, I have an **X** in one of the bits. So, what will happen if I perform an AND operation with **X**? Let’s take AND. So, `1 & 0` means it is `0`. `X & 0` in an operation will always result in `X`. `1 & 1` means `1`. `1 & 1` means `1`. So, now, it will give `1 1 X 0`. This is a bitwise operation. Understood, Tana? Yes, ma’am. Okay, ma’am, I have one doubt, ma’am. Yeah, for suppose there is a “don’t care” (`X`), but in the case of a bitwise AND, it should be `0`. Which one is correct? For the bitwise AND or logical AND, if one of the inputs is `0`, the output will always be `0`. Ma'am, okay? You check in the tool. Go to the tool. Okay, okay. In that, write some module and assign values to `a` and `b`, and give some unknown values. Check it. Do you check it? What value will you get? Okay, okay. You check and tell me whether you'll get this value or if you'll get `0`. Ma'am, okay? Yeah, so in tomorrow's class, you tell me what the result will be. Sure, Ma'am. Okay. So, next is the reduction operator. In the reduction operator, you will have the same operators: AND, negation, OR, negation OR (NOR), etc. You should not confuse these operators with the standard ones, like `&&` for logical AND or `&` for bitwise AND. Now, again, you have a single `&` operator here. The operands for this operator must be a single operand. However, for logical AND and bitwise AND, you have two operands—that’s the difference. Okay? So, for the reduction operator, you have a single operand. Okay? So, how does it work? Here’s an example: `a = 1101`. So, the… Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

It will be a single bit. So, if I give a reduction AND (`&`) operation, it will operate on all the bits recursively. It will start from the right side. So, if I have a reduction AND like `1 & 1 & 0 & 1`, what it will do is: First, it will perform `1 & 1`, which gives `1`. Then, it will do `1 & 0`, which gives `0`. Finally, it will do `0 & 1`, which gives `0`. So, the output will be `0`. Similarly, for a reduction OR (`|`), if I have `0 | 1`, it will give `1`. If I have `1 | 1`, it will give `1`. Again, `1 | 1` will give `1`. So, it will start from the right side, bit by bit, and produce a single-bit value. Logical operators also give a single-bit result, and reduction operators also give a single-bit result.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! A single bit, but for bitwise operations, it depends on the number of bits present in the inputs. Similarly, you can give examples for the NOR operation. For instance, for a negation-NOR operation, if the inputs are `1 1`, the negation-NOR of `1` again results in `0`. So, `1 1` negation-NOR is `0`, and `0` negation-NOR is `0`. Therefore, `0` and `1` negation-NOR is `0`, and `0` and `1` negation-NOR is `0`. Bit by bit, it processes the inputs from the right side and gives a single-bit output. So, logical, bitwise, and reduction operations are very important. So, there will be confusion with these three. Please make a note:  
- **Logical Operators**: You’ll get a single output. Even if you give multiple bits, it will be converted into a single bit, and the result will also be a single bit.  
- **Bitwise Operators**: It will perform bitwise operations. How many input bits there are, that’s how many output bits you’ll get.  
- **Reduction Operators**: You’ll have a single operand. It will perform the operation bit by bit, starting from the right side.  

Any doubts about these three? Ma’am, explain? Or ma’am, OR, OR NOT, OR, OR… Okay, so I have a value `a`, which is `1101`. One, zero, and one—what is the OR of one? It is one. So again, this… One and the output of the previous one. Okay, okay. That is one. Got it. One and the previous one—it is one. It will take the previous result of two bits. Yes, ma’am. Yes, ma’am. Okay. So, next, we have the arithmetic operators. The first three are very important, so make a note on those three things. Arithmetic operators: here, you’ll have two operands. Okay? So, we have addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Minus. Okay? So, let me take an example here. I have `a` as `01`, `b` as `111`, and `c` as `010`. Now, if I take `a + a`—`01` and `01`—I will get `10`. Okay? If I do subtraction for `B` and `C`, where `B` is `111` and `C` is `010`, the result will be `5`, which is `101` in binary. So, if we want to do multiplication, I will use the multiplication operator, which is `*`. If I consider `A` as `01` (which is `1` in decimal), then `1 * 2` will give the result as `2`, which is `10` in binary. Similarly, for division, you'll get a quotient, and for modulus, you'll get a remainder. So, for your assignment, which involves subtraction, how can you implement this? Hint: In normal decimal values, if I give `10`... Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Plus or minus of five. Now, this "minus of five" is your unary minus. These are the arithmetic operators. I want you to try all these operators in the tool. Use different values and check the results. Next, we have relational operators. Relational operators are used to check whether a value is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another value. In relational operators, we need two operands, and the operator will produce a single bit: either `true` or `false`. If any of the operands have an `X` or `Z` value, the output will also be `X`. So, if I take...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Here’s the corrected version:

---

Example:  
I have `a = 01`, `b = 7`, and `c = 2`.  

If I take `a < b`, what is the value of `a`? It is `1`. What about `b`? It is `7`. Is it true that `a` is less than `b`? Yes, so it is true, and I will get the result as `1`.  

Now, if I take the next example: `b < c`. `b` is `7`, and `c` is `2`. But this is wrong—`b` is not less than `c`. So, for that case, I will get the result as `0`.  

If at all you have any unknown bits here, like an `X` in the value of `b`, and if I perform any operation with this, I will get the result as `X`. For example, if I take `a < b`, where `a` has a value of `1` but `b` contains an `X`, the total value of `b` is unknown. So, for that case, I will get the result as an unknown value (`X`).  

Okay, just a minute—I will address this.  

--- 

Let me know if you need further adjustments! Okay, so if you look at this one: **greater than or equal**. Let me take `a` and `b` as `011`. Similarly, I will take `c` as `011`.  

Now, if I do `b >= c`, the **greater than** part will fail because `b` is not greater than `c`. However, the **equal** part will be true, so for that sake, I will get it as a **true** value.  

Similarly, for **less than or equal**: If the **less than** condition is not satisfied, it will check for the **equal** condition. If the **equal** condition is also not satisfied, but the **less than** condition is satisfied, then it will give the result as **true**.  

These are the relational operators, which produce a single bit: either **true** or **false**. So, you'll be having **greater than**, **less than**, and other relational operators.   Greater than or equal to, less than or equal to—okay, so these are the relational operators. Then, you have the equality operator. In the equality operator, we use it to compare two operands, and this will produce a single bit: either `true` or `false`. Okay, so, in the equality operator, you have two types: logical equality and case equality. When you go to logical equality, if any one of the bits is `X`, it will give an `X` value. Logical equality checks only for `1`s and `0`s—it does not check for `X`. It will give it as unknown. In case equality, it will consider both `X` and `Z`. If any of the bits are `X` or `Z`, it will compare them and give the output. Okay, so the case equality operator will never... The result will be `X` (unknown). Okay? So, either it will give `true` or `false`. Okay. If I take an example, here we have logical equality (`==`), logical inequality (`!=`), case equality (`===`), and case inequality (`!==`). These are the operators, and the operands are two. Okay? So, if I take an example: Consider `a = 01X`, `b = 111`, and `c = 01X`. If I take `c == a` (logical equality), since both `c` and `a` have `X` values, it will not compare them. It will result in `unknown`. Okay? So, if I take `a === c` (case equality), then it… The output will be `1`. For **logical equality**, it considers only `0` and `1`. If there are `X` or `Z` values, it will result in an unknown value. For **case equality**, it considers both `X` and `Z` values and will never result in an `X` value. If I take `C` for not equal (`!=`), and there is an unknown value, it will treat it as `X`. For **case inequality** (`!==`), if the values are equal, the condition will evaluate to `false`. If I take case inequality, the same logic applies. Are there any doubts about this, ma’am? Here, note that `case` and `case` are two different things. Speak louder:  

In case statements, you also have **case X** and **case Z**. These will appear in case statements. Okay, okay. Here, these are the operators. K6 and KSET will come in conditional statements. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.  

Next, you have the **concatenation** and **replication** operators. So, what does concatenation mean? You will be combining bits. The concatenation operator is used to combine bits and group signals or buses.  

Then, we have the **replication operator**, which is used for repeating a value. So, how many times the value has to be repeated? How will you write it?   These two are so we have a syntax here for symbols. For concatenation, I have a flower bracket, and inside that, there’s a comma. Within this comma, we have to write the values. The operands will be two or more. For replication, you have `n` in the flower bracket, followed by a comma. `n` means how many times it has to be repeated, and you can give the number here. For example, if I consider this, I have `a` as `01`, `b` as `11`, and `c` as `01x`. Now, for concatenation, I have in the flower bracket: I’ve taken `b`, comma `a`, comma `a`. What it will do is: `a` means the first two values (LSB), which is `01`. Again, `a` means it is `01`. `b` is `11`. So here, it is the `b` value. The output depends on how many bits you are concatenating. For that sake, in this example, I… Six bits, so the output should be six bits. When you are assigning to any variable, you have to define it as a six-bit value. Okay? So, this concatenation combines the number of bits or sometimes signals. In the repetitive operation, it means replication. Here, I have `a` and `b`. First, I have to concatenate `a` and `b`, and then I have a `2`, meaning it has to be repeated two times. `b` means the value is `11`, so I have `11` here. `a` means it is `101`. Okay? Now, this concatenated value has to be repeated twice. Right? This is one repetition, so this value is repeated one more time. So, now, how many bits should it be? It should be eight bits. Eight bits. So, I have given six bits, but it should be eight bits. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

You should not randomly decide the number of bits like this. Intentionally, I made this mistake so that I could explain it. You should calculate the number of bits and then mention how many bits the output will have. You cannot randomly choose a number like six bits, eight bits, or ten bits. Initially, you need to calculate how many bits the output value might be based on the concatenation. Only then can you declare the number of bits correctly. This involves understanding both concatenation and replication. Any doubts about this? No, ma’am. Okay. Others? Yes or no? No. Yeah.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

So, next, you have the shift operator. In the shift operator, you have a left shift and a right shift. The left shift uses two arrow marks pointing to the left (`<<`), and the right shift uses two arrow marks pointing to the right (`>>`). You need two operands. If you use `>>`, it’s a right shift, and if you use `<<`, it’s a left shift. The empty portion or the empty places will be filled with zeros. So, if I consider this binary value: `0010`, now I have `0010`. If I want to do a left shift by two, I want to shift the value two times to the left. In the first shift, what it will do is: The `0` will move here, the `1` will move here, and...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Zero will come here, so this zero is neglected. Okay? Now, the empty space here will be filled with the zero value. Okay? In the next shift, this one will move here, this zero will move here, this zero will move here, and the last position will be filled with zero. So, now, this is the second shift. Okay? Since I’m asked to perform two shifts, I’m doing two shifts. Now, you can see the value of `a` is here: two. Right? What is the value of `a` here? What is the value of this one? Eight. So, for one right shift, you’ll have a multiplication of two. Okay? Any value will be multiplied by two. So, here, for the first shift, it will be four, and for the second shift, it is eight. For the left shift, the value will be multiplied by… For every shift, if I go with the **right shift**, the same value applies. If I consider `0010`, and if I do one shift, the `1` will move here: `000`. The empty place will be filled with `0`. So, this is `2`, and this is `1`. Here, you can tell that if I do one shift to the right, it will be divisible by `2`.  

Consider this: If I have `0100`, which is `4`. Now, if I do one shift to the right, I will get `0010`, which is `2`. That is, `4` divided by `2`. Is that understood?  

Shift operators will perform the shifting, and the empty or vacated portion will be filled with `0`s. So... You have a right shift and a left shift. I want you guys to check whether there is an arithmetic shift in Verilog, okay? For your assignment, you have to check if there is an arithmetic shift in Verilog or not. Yes, ma’am. VS-DL, you have it—is there? Yeah, it is there. It is there, but I want you to check in your tools. Tomorrow, I want anyone of you to explain that, okay? Arithmetic shift in Verilog. So, if you don’t understand, I will explain. Okay, so for the arithmetic shift, you’ll be having… Three times like this for the right shift, and three times like this for the left shift. Okay, I want to use these things, and I want you guys to check them in the tools. So, this is the **shift operator**. The last operator is the **conditional operator**. The conditional operator is used to choose one of two values based on a condition. According to the condition, you have a syntax here: `condition ? true_expression : false_expression`. If the condition is true, it takes the value of the `true_expression`; otherwise, it takes the value of the `false_expression`. This is the conditional operator, and it requires three operands. For example, you can implement a multiplexer (mux) using this operator. So, in a 2-to-1 mux, if the select line is `0`, the output will be `A`. If the select line is `1`, the output will be `B`, right? How can you write this? If `sel` is `0`, the output (`out`) will be `A`. If `sel` is `1` (which is true), the output will be `B`. Otherwise, it will be `A`. You can write a mux using operators like this:  

```verilog
out = sel ? B : A;
```

You can also implement a mux using the conditional operator. When you use this approach, you need to use an **assign statement**, which is part of data flow modeling. To do this, you must use the `assign` keyword. If we consider your specification as... Equal to 1, that time I should get `a`. If `s` is 0, I should get `b`. This is the equation. Whenever the select line is 1, `a` will go as the output. If the select line is 0, `b` will go as the output. Yes, Ruchitini, ma’am, can you repeat it once again? Okay. So, in the conditional operator, you have a syntax. You have to give the condition. If it is true, the true value will go to the output. If it is false, the false value will go as the output. So, in the 2-to-1 multiplexer, you have the `s` value. When `s` is 0, okay? When `s` is 0, I will consider my output as `out`. The output is `out`, so I will get it as `b`. If I consider it like that, if `s` is 1, okay? So that… I will get it as `a`. If you consider it like this, okay. So, when I write using the conditional operator, first comes the condition expression. What is the condition expression? I have to check with `s`, yes. So, I will take it as `s`. Then comes the question mark. What is the true expression? If `s` is 1 (meaning `s` is true), okay. What value should go as the output? That is `a`. Otherwise, the output should be `b`. So, this expression `(s ? a : b)` I will assign it to my output variable, `out`. The true value will be the first part, right? Yes, the true value will be the first part. Okay. So, for this conditional operator, I have to use the `assign` keyword. Okay, this `assign` will come in the data flow modeling. Operators will be used in both data flow modeling and behavioral modeling, okay. But the logical operators will be used in the behavioral modeling. Because we need either `true` or `false` in behavioral modeling, and for bitwise operations, we can use them in data flow modeling. So, all these operators are used for writing different modeling styles. For structural, gate-level, and switch-level modeling, there is no need for operators—we just need to know the data types, primitive gates, and how the connections are made between the components. For data flow modeling and behavioral modeling, you need operators. So, next, let’s talk about operator precedence. The first priority in operators is given to parentheses and bit selection. As you know, in C language and other programming languages, the same principle applies... Priority will be given to the values inside the brackets, right? After that, the operations outside the brackets will be performed. The next priority is given to logical negation and reduction, followed by addition and subtraction (arithmetic operations). Then, you have concatenation and replication. Next, you have arithmetic shift, relational, and equality operators. Finally, bitwise and conditional operators have the lowest priority.  

For example, if I consider `a + b` and then inside the brackets, if I take the negation of `c` (like `~c`), what it will do is first go to the brackets and perform the negation of `c`. That value I will consider as `z`. Sonali is in waiting. Sonal is in waiting, okay. Okay, so when I do this, the negation of `c` will be considered as `Z`—any value. Now, this `Z` is performing some operation with `b`. So, `b` in the bracket, `Z` has come, plus `a`. Now, `a + b` of `Z` means these two operations will be performed. So, now it is a multiplication, so I will get some value as `X`. Then, it is `a + 6`, so I will get it as `y`. So, `y` will be my final output. The first priority is given to the brackets—the operations inside the brackets will be done first. Later, the priority is given to the operations outside the brackets. This is the precedence. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Ma’am, yeah. In Verilog, we go from left to right or right to left. So, you’re asking about the order of operations, right? Ma’am, suppose we have multiple operations. Can you give me an example, like `y = 2 + (3 / 5)` or something, ma’am? Right? Yes, ma’am. So, we go from right to left or left to right. Actually, these two operations are performed first. Nope, in some cases, like in C programming or something similar, I think we go from left to right. That’s why I’m asking. In Verilog, so in Verilog...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! It is similar to all programming languages, ma'am. I’m not entirely sure, which is why I’m asking. So, if I do this and get some value here—like `4 * 5` equals `20`, and then divide by `5`—how would you handle this? You’re saying that if I process it from left to right, the output might change, and if I process it from right to left, I might get a default value. I’ll get back to you by tomorrow. Sure, yeah, I’ll check and get back to you on that. Ma’am, I think it’s similar to all programming languages, but I’m not certain—it’s the app. I’ll check and let you know. I think the first equation and later bitwise are… I think, like in the table, that was in there. No, what he’s asking is: If I have something like `-20 / 5`, okay? So, `p2 = -20`. Here, yes, ma’am, it’s the subscription operation. So, here, it’s the arithmetic operation, but it’s under unary, right? Unary minus and plus. Yeah. What about subtraction and addition? Below that, it’s binary minus and binary plus. So, according to this table, if I go step by step, this will be done first. Okay? It’s divided by five. Yeah, divided by five. Okay? So, if I go according to this, `20 / 5` is done first. Then it will do this one. I think here, whether it’s left-to-right or right-to-left doesn’t matter. Yes, ma’am. Ma’am, it will matter. Ma’am, I mean, so it’s just a simple expression—if you take a guess, it takes complex inspiration, it will matter. If both operators have the same priority, yeah, if they have the same priority, then it will matter. But here, the priorities are different—both operators are not having the same priority. No. But in case there’s an example right now, you have parentheses and you have two operations, like inside brackets. So, which one will you perform first? If I do this one, yes, ma’am. I have `+10 + 2` in between some other operations, right, ma’am? It matters, ma’am. Left-to-right and right-to-left—right. First, it will do the bracket operations. Mhmm. So, first, it will do the bracket operations. Yeah, it will perform the bracket operations. But after… Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

That’s right. If there are other operations involved, it will matter whether we track from left to right or right to left. So, we’ll try and check it. We can only verify this using the tool. Using the tool, we’ll verify it. Okay, okay. Is someone in the waiting room? Yeah. So, what do we have to check? We have to check the operators with unknown values. So, we need to check logical NOT, logical, and bitwise operations with unknown values. Then, we need to check the precedence. These two things we have to check. Okay. And also, we need to check arithmetic shift.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! You need to implement automatic shifting, and then we have code examples using these operators. You can create adders, such as `a + b + c`, and generate an adder model. Using conditional operators or any other operators, you can write multiplexers (muxes) and design various digital circuits. In this example, the address has `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`, and the sum is 9 bits long, including the carry. Instead of manually drawing diagrams or using gates, you can use these operators to perform addition, such as an 8-bit adder. For the mux, we saw one way using conditional operators. Another way... Things you can use the bitwise operator. Now, in this case, I have a single bit, but if it involves two or three bits, using a logical `AND` would be incorrect because it would give a single-bit output. In data flow modeling, we’ll use bitwise operations. For example, your equation is `Y = A'S + B'S'`. If it’s structured like this, for `S'` (the negation of `S`), we apply the negation to `B` along with this. Here, I’m using `AND` between `A` and `S`, and between this result and another value, I’m using `OR`. So, you must use bitwise operations for these. Using these operators, we can write the design for different scenarios. So, what hardware components will you get by using these operators? When I use the plus symbol, I will get an adder. When I use `AND`, you’ll get an AND gate. When I use a minus, you’ll get a subtractor. Sometimes, directly, you’ll get a subtractor, or you might get one input along with a NOT gate implemented. You’ve probably come across this in your logic design—subtractors, half subtractors, full subtractors. There will be one input along with a NOT gate. It depends on the tool. The synthesis tool will determine the hardware implementation. So, if I use the conditional operator, you’ll get a 2-to-1 multiplexer. And for `==`, `>`, `<`, you’ll get comparators. These symbols you should not… Get confused with blocking and non-blocking? Blocking and non-blocking, we'll see in tomorrow's session. Here, the comparison operators like `==`, `>=`, `<=` are used as comparators. These are some hardware inferences of the operators. Any questions about operators? I will go to the TDF Playground. If I have the operator code already done, we'll see it. Yeah, I have some operator examples. I’ve just taken `a + b` and `b + c`, like this. Okay? So, in the design, I’ve just taken it as a module `op_reg(a, b, result)` with `reg [3:0]` for four bits initialized to `0`. Then, I’ve given some `a` and `b` values, and the addition and multiplication are done.  

So, let me do whatever you ask now. I’ll add here: `c = 4'b1x01`. I’ll take that. Then, what I’ll do is `a & c`. Okay? So, I’ll run this one. "C" is an identifier, okay? I mean, whether you write it in a design or a test bench, it doesn’t matter—we’re just checking how the operators will behave. Whether it’s not a design or not a test bench, okay? I think it’s given in decimal. If I take it in binary, I mean, display "C," ma’am. Okay, "C"—this is "C." I’ll display it in binary. So, what is the result? How many bits is it? Five bits, okay. `a` and `c`—here, it is 0. Yeah, what you said is correct: `x` AND with any 0 is treated as 0 for the AND operation only, ma’am. But for OR, it will treat `x` as `x`. Yeah, that’s right. I will now change it. I’ll change it to OR. So, for OR, it will treat it as… For all, yes. No, one more thing—I’ll make it as `1` here. So, now I’ll make it as `&`, and it will take `X`. Yeah, that’s correct. Only when the second input is `X`, it will take it as `X`. Yes, ma’am. Because the `N`-digit is enabled with `1` only, so the output will depend on the second input, which is `X`. Yeah, yes, ma’am. Okay.  

Only for `0`, it will give it as `0`. Okay. So, which one again did we want to do, ma’am? For this, ma’am, we don’t need to write a separate design and test. Ma’am, no, no, no—it’s just verifying the operators. No, so it doesn’t mean providing the waveform or anything like that. If you want the waveform, anyhow, you have an `initial` block here. So, just a minute—I’ll... Now, generally, in tools, the `initial` block is not allowed in the design itself. I think in the design, yeah—in tools, yeah. If I copy this, no, it won’t provide the form while writing this in the design. Wait a minute—it’s not written. I mean, I’m testing, and it’s never written in the test bench. Only the `initial` block is used in the test bench, not in the design. Actually, there’s no comparison between the design and the test bench here. We’ll make it clear: the design and the test bench are separate. Here, if you write the `initial` block in the test bench, you’ll get the output, and you’ll see the waveform in this tool. What the tool does is, if you write `$dumpvars` only in the test bench, you’ll get the waveform. So, the tool processes the test bench to generate the waveform. Test the testbench separately and design separately, but when we write the code in other tools, okay? Just depending on the name, depending on the name, we don’t declare inputs and outputs. No, depending on that, it will consider whether it is a design or a testbench. K, miss. In this case, like if you do something like applying operations in the design and calling it in the testbench, will it work, ma’am? Yeah, that will work, but you should have inputs and outputs, yes, ma’am. In the design, we’ll provide the inputs and then handle them. You can also do that. And one thing more, ma’am: Like here, you have considered `a[3:0]`, `b`, and `c`. So, if I take `reg` for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and I provide `a` with a 4-bit input, meaning 4 bits, will it work? If `a` is `[4:0]`, no, no—from here, I’ve already moved to `[3:0]`. I’ve just considered `a`, `e`, and `c`. Mhmm. So, now, if you do it like this, I told you earlier that it might take the LSB value, or it will show a warning or an error. As I know, it will take the LSB value. See, it will take only the LSB value. Okay? If you write it like that, mhmm, so it will take only the LSB value and perform the operation.  

Okay, one more thing we wanted to check—which one is that? Logical operators, I think. Right. For logical AND and all the logical and bitwise operations, we’ve already covered them. Now, I need to check the precedence. So, `a + b`—tell me some equations. Multiply it by `c`, multiply it by `2`, minus some value, divide it by another value. The value of `a` is `7`, and the value of `b` is `8`. Multiply by `2`—there’s no problem. Again, take the values in decimal; it will be easier to calculate. Yeah, that will be `2 - 1`—I’ve taken that. Mhmm, okay. Now, divide by `4`, divide by `6`. Okay. So, where is the waveform? We’ll see the result. Oh, just a minute—I’ve changed it here. I’ll comment out the other things and keep only the first one. So, **a** is 7, and **b** is 8. If I make 7 plus 8, it is 15. Fifteen times 2—if I take it from the left side, it’s 30. Thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty, minus 1, twenty-nine. Twenty-nine, twenty-nine, twenty-nine, divided by 6, four point something (decimal). Okay, so let me convert this to decimal as well. I think you’re getting a negative because the result is one bit extra. No, so it’s doing it from right to left. What’s the value it’s showing? Twenty-three. What was it in binary, Ma'am? What was the output in binary? In binary, it was `10`. Just a minute—I will display both in binary and in decimal. Okay. So, `1011` in binary is `23` in decimal. If I start from the left, `29 / 6` is `4`—right? Four point something. Okay. If I start from the right, `1 / 6` is `0`. That's right—that's right. Seven plus sixteen is twenty-three. Yeah, minus zero. Twenty-three—from right to left. Going from right to left—I mean, some right-to-left, right? Yes, Ma'am. Yeah, right-to-left or left-to-right—right-to-left. One divided by sixteen first is `0`. So, one divided by six is `0`. Right? Two minus zero means zero. Two. Two. So, two times `b`, two times `a`, two is sixteen. Sixteen plus seven is twenty-three. Twenty-three—using a higher division operator, not a modulo operator. Yeah, it is. Divide means what is the quotient? One divided by six is zero point something, right? The quotient, so I’ll consider it as a whole number, which is zero. Okay? So, it’s doing from right to left—is that clear for everyone? It is from right to left. Yes, ma’am. Ma’am, once interchange the division and multiplication operators. Ma’am, interchange their places. Interchange their places. Okay? Here, I will do the division. Yeah, here, start. Calculate the value and keep running until I finish. It is starting. It is a five. So, if I start from the right, six minus two will be minus-four. So, `b` is eight minus two, which is six. Ma'am, five minus seven is minus-two. Ma'am, correct? Ma'am, right-to-left only—right-to-left. Is it correct? Yes, Ma'am. Yeah, from right to left, it will also consider the precedence of the individual operators. Precedence of the individual operators—yes, Ma'am. Yes, division first, then multiplication, and then... Yeah, then like that. That's what I meant—not blindly right-to-left. Yeah, right—not only will it take right-to-left; it will also follow the operator precedence table. I understand. Mhmm, that will also be considered. Yes, Ma'am. First division, then multiplication, and then... So, which one do I have to check next? Arithmetic—you will check and come, or we'll see it here itself? Okay, we will—we'll do it by ourselves, and we'll check. Yeah, you do it by yourself, check it, and tomorrow, anyhow, in the class, we'll open this and check it. Okay, tomorrow we have a class, Ma'am. Why? What, Ma'am? I have a doubt. Saturday? Saturday, I don't know—it's Monday, okay? Okay, we'll be having class on Monday, Ma'am. I have a doubt. Yeah, so I was telling that if we consider it from right to left and if we consider the precedence order, we should do the division first, right? So, if you do the division first, the answer is not five. Eight divided by two is four. One divided by two—which is eight divided by two—is four. Four minus three is four minus one, which is three minus six. No, four minus one, which is three. Three... Two times six is eighteen. No, you have to perform one times six as well—one times six. One times six—you also have to do that. Oh, okay. Okay, I got it. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so we’ll continue with the theory. Any doubts? Again, no, ma’am. Okay. So, I will go back to the slides. We’ll take a break. Now, it is 11:45, so we’ll come back at 12. Okay. Okay, awesome. Okay, ma’am. Yeah, ma’am. Okay. I… I’m... I’m... I’m. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! I... I... I... I’m. I... I... I'm... I'm... I'm... I... I... I'm... Uh-huh. I’m… I’m... I’m... I’m... I’m… I’m… I’m… I’m... Hello, guys. So, everyone is back. Please take my case. Alright, I will launch the poll, which will be regarding operators. Okay, answer it. It has ten questions, so take ten minutes. Take the poll questions. Once you finish the poll, take Marquez. I. I’m… I… I… I’m… I’m… I... I’m... I... I... I’m. I’m... I... I... I'm... I'm... I'm... I… I… I… I’m… I’m… I’m... I am so sorry, but twenty-four of you have submitted. Harshita, yeah, I submitted. Okay, you’re doing great. So, Chintan, submit—we’ll note that. Ma’am, submitted. Submitted. Okay, so I think everyone has finished. One person who hasn’t finished yet—I’ll send a reminder. Okay, so we’ll end the poll. We’ll share the results. Is it visible? Okay, yes, ma’am. Okay, so the first one—so `a` is… Zero. `g` is `7`, so `7` divided by `3`—what will be the quotient? Okay, the quotient is `2`. So, the answer is the first one.  

I think some of you wrote the remainder. If you write it as `1`, that’s the modulus. Okay, the answer is the first one.  

For the second question, `c` and `e` values are given as logical equality. So, `c` has `1'bx`, and `e` has `1'bx`. It will not consider the `X` values, so you will get an unknown value, which is `1'bx`. The second answer is correct.  

For the second question, the answer is the second one.  

Next, for the third one, `a` is `0`, and `b` is `1`. I’m asking whether `a` is greater than `b` or not. `a` is not greater than `b`—it’s false. So, the answer is the third one, which is `0` (one bit).  

For the fourth...   Ocean, so I have `a = 1101` and `b = 1100`. The operation is given as a reduction XOR. It will be done from the right. So, `0 XOR 0` is `0`. Then, `1 XOR 0` is `1`. Next, `1 XOR 1` is `0`. Finally, `1 XOR 0` is `1`. So, the answer is a single bit: `0`. Okay, the answer is the second option.  

Next, we have the fifth question. This is a double line (`||`), which means it is a logical OR operation. You’ll get the answer in a single bit. So, what about `a` and `b`? `a` is true, and `b` is false. Since the OR operation is true, you have to answer it as a single bit: `1`. So, the answer is the second option. Some of you have written a 4-bit answer, but it is a logical operation. Logical operators will always give the result in a single bit. Okay, so the next question is now a bitwise XOR. It is a bitwise XOR. Here, the answer is `11` for the last MSB value, which is `11`. The XOR operation is `0`. Then, I have an unknown (`X`), and `11` means `0`. `10` is `1`. So, the answer is the first option.  

Okay, so the next question—seventh question—is a left shift by two. It is the last four bits: `1000`. It is a left shift by two of `c`. So, the answer is…  

Then, the eighth question: `d` has to be shifted right by eight times. You’ll get eight times, which means all zeros. The answer is third: all zeros (eight bits), zeros, then ninth: one. Concatenation: `b || a || a`. Okay, so `b` is three bits, and `a` is two bits. Three plus two is five, then six, seven bits. So, the value will be seven bits. First, it is `b || a`, so the most significant bit (MSB) will be `b`, which is `01X`. Then you have `01` and `01`. The answer is second: one. Okay, so for the tenth question: two times of `a`, so you’ll have four bits: `01` and `01`. That is the second answer. Okay, so these are the questions based on operators. Just make a note of these operators—they will be useful. Okay? There will be confusion only between logical reduction and bitwise operators. You’ll get confused for nine and size `c`, right? Seven bits—which one: nine or seven? Yes, I see. Ninth question, ninth question—no, ma’am. Ninth question… mhmm. So, for the ninth question, you have `baa`, which is `b0x1`. That will be in the MSB part: `0x1`. Then you have `aa` as `01`, and again, `am` is `01`. That makes the third answer: seven bits. It is seven bits because `b` is three bits, `a` is two bits, and again, `a` is two bits, so it totals seven bits. The answer is the third option. Okay, okay. I’ll stop sharing the results, sir. Just a minute. I’m... Okay, so we’ll take this up in the next session. I will share this PPT. Next, you have data flow modeling. In data flow modeling, we will use operators, and you’ll use the assignment keyword. In data flow modeling, you should know the equations. Data flow models are developed using equations that represent the design. In data flow modeling, you’ll use conditional expressions, and those conditional expressions will act as switching controls. Here, you’ll use the assignment statement. So, we'll take up this example. It's the same thing: a 2-to-1 multiplexer. As I explained using the conditional operator, I will have a module, followed by the module name, then the port list. Next, I have the inputs and outputs. Okay? Then, I have the `assign` keyword. This is the keyword you use when writing data flow modeling. After that, I have `y = if (sel == 1) ? b : a;`. Yes, I will get it as `b` if the condition is true, and otherwise, I will get it as `a`.  

In data flow modeling, we use `assign` statements. This `assign` statement will be triggered or executed whenever there is a change in the values of the variables. If you have multiple `assign` statements—for example, in different parts of the code—you'll be using multiple `assign` statements. At that time, what will happen? All the `assign` statements will be executed **in parallel**. But... Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Upon the input values, the change in the input values will trigger the logic. Okay, so let me take some other examples. Here, I have a half-adder. This is my half-adder. Gerald, even if `A` and `B` change, unless or until `Y` changes, the output won’t get reflected. No, in the previous code, as soon as `A` and `B` change, you’re saying that `Y` will get updated. No, ma’am. Yeah, it depends on the `Y` condition. No, so it depends on `Y`. Here, I’m using a conditional operator, but in some codes, I can use XOR or NOT gates, and at that time, those operations and their results will trigger the assignment statements. Okay, so first, it will perform this operation using the assignment statement, and the value will be updated accordingly.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Yes, okay, ma’am. Okay, assigning the values, okay, ma’am. Okay, so next, you have a half adder. In the half adder, you have an XOR and an AND. Here, in the half adder, you have an XOR and an AND. Here, **a** and **b** are the inputs, and **s** and **c** are the outputs. When I use the `assign` statement, `assign s = a ^ b;`—this is XOR. So, I have a caret (`^`), and this is a bitwise operation. It is not logical; it is bitwise because sometimes your inputs may be 3 bits or 4 bits. At that time, if you use a logical operator, you’ll get a single bit as output, which would be incorrect. So, here, you’ll use bitwise operations. For **s**, it is `a ^ b`, and for **c**, it is `a & b`. So... This is the end operation. This is for a half adder. We’ll be using the `assign` keyword, and you’re writing the outputs. One more thing: When you are using the `assign` keyword, `s` and `c` should be of a `wire` type. By default, they will be of a `wire` type, so you should not make them `reg` types—they should be `wire` types. For `assign` statements, the output should always be of a `wire` type. Also, we call these `assign` statements “continuous assignment statements.” Miss, continuously—whenever there is a change in the `a` and `b` values, it will reassign the output to `c` and `s` (or `n_c` here). Okay, so we are using the `assign` keyword, and the output should be of a `wire` type.  

Again, so can anyone tell me about this one—for the full adder? Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

This will have a statement that is assigned as `A + B + C`. Sorry, it should be `A & B & C` for the sum. Okay. For the three AND gates, the first AND will be assigned as a wire type. We can give it like `w1 = B & A & C`. Correspondingly, we’ll write it for the other AND gates as well. After that, we would have given the output of each AND gate as a wire, so `w1`, `w2`, `w3`. For the carry, it will be `carry = w1 + w2 + w3`. Assigned? No, here it is not `w2`, ma’am. All operations should use the parallel pipe (`||`) operator. Okay, ma’am. We can do it directly like `assign` if you want. You can write `A + B + C`. Yes, ma’am. Okay. Okay. That time...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! That’s correct. For the sum and carry, you have to split and write them separately. Otherwise, you’ll need to take one extra bit for the sum and carry indication. Yes, ma’am. So here, I’m having a single bit for `a`, a single bit for `b`, and a single bit for `c`. Now, if you calculate `a + b + c` using the arithmetic operator, the result will require two bits: one bit for the sum and the other bit for the carry. If you’re using arithmetic operators, the sum will be two bits.  

However, if you want to use bitwise operators like `&`, `|`, or `^`, you can calculate it as `a & b | b & c | c & a` for the carry. So, for the carry, it will be `a & b | b & c | c & a`. `a` and `b`, okay. Okay. Then `r = b || a && b`. Okay. `b && c`, then again pipe, then it is `c && a && a`. Ma’am, I didn’t get that. `sum = a + b + c`—this one. Yeah, that’s why I’m asking. Exactly, this is according to your diagram, the logic diagram. Yeah, right. So, for this one, the truth table. Okay, the truth table—if you take `a`, `b`, and `c`, okay. If you consider the truth table, you can directly use this: `a + b + c`. Okay. Okay. If you don’t want this diagram directly, you can use arithmetic operators for this. We should assign like a vector form—a vector form—for some of these two. You have to combine these two so that you assign `sum` as `[1:0]`. This `sum` will include both the carry and the added value. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`, what will the sum value be? One moment—I’ll complete this. What is the value of `a + b + c`? If I give all `1`s (`1 + 1 + 1`), the sum is `1`, and the carry is `1`, right? Yes, ma’am. Yeah.  

Now, if I assign this result (`11`) to `sum`, which is a 2-bit value, you’ll get the output as `11`. At that time, you must understand that the MSB (most significant bit) will represent the carry, and the LSB (least significant bit) will represent the sum. Ma’am, okay.  

Someone has raised... Hand, hello, ma’am. Yeah, yeah, ma’am. Actually, that’s exactly what I want to ask. How do you give this for all actors? How do you use data for… yeah, that’s it. Now, you understood. Can you take any 4-to-1 mux or something like that? So, it will be a 4-to-1 mux. Okay, so for a 4-to-1 mux, `a` is 4 bits, so you link the range as `3 downto 0`, right? Now, the select line is also 2 bits: `1 downto 0`. Uh-huh, okay. So, what will be the equation for the output of a 4-to-1 mux? You have to write that lengthy equation. You have to write it, yeah. Correct. Yeah, that we have tried. Not into… Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

I’m not sure about `A` and `B`. You have to write the complete equation using bitwise operators in the assignment statements. Okay, okay. There is no shortcut or something like that. We have to follow the rules. Okay, okay. For adders, you can use shortcuts because you have arithmetic operators. Okay, okay. For marks, I think you can use conditional operators. No, we can use conditional operators, ma’am. There are conditional operators you can use. Okay. After the question mark (`?`), you have to include another condition. Alright, okay, okay, okay. Instead of a condition, you can use another approach. Okay, okay, okay. Otherwise, in between, you have to take some wires and use four conditional operators, and then you can use that. That is a special way to handle conditions. No, which one? Jerome is saying that after the question mark (`?`), we need to give another...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

The condition for a 4-to-1 multiplexer is handled using two select lines. After the question mark (`?`), you specify the inputs. Here, you can write it like this: The output will be equal to the selected value. It’s not `==` (double equals); it’s a single equals sign. For the first select line, if it’s `00`, then after the question mark (`?`), what value will go as the output? Let me take `A[0]`. Yes, that’s correct. The colon (`:`) indicates continuation. Again, I’ll check for the next condition. Sorry, it’s `==` (double equals) for `B[01]`. Again, after the question mark (`?`), what value will go? `A[1]`. Again, the colon (`:`) continues...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Yes, double equal. If `yes` is 2 bits (`10`), then `yes == 2'b10 ? a[2:0] :`… the last value is what I want. Again, check for `yes`. Directly, I will write `a[3]` like this. It can be written in a nested form, but it is a lengthy process, ma’am. Ma’am, what if I write `s[0], s[1] ? a : b : c : b`? Can you repeat? If I write it like this—comparing to the 2-to-1 mux, where we wrote `a ? a : b`—I will write it however you tell me. I will write it, okay? Sure. Yes, but this is for the 2-to-1 mux. One max, two-to-one `A`… yeah, `A:B` right. Next, `A:B`—this is for a two-to-one mux. See, here, if it’s a single bit, you can directly write `s`. But if it’s multiple bits, you have to use `==` (case equality). See? No, you have to use that. Okay, okay, okay. This `=` means we can write `s != 1`? Follow the column `B`, column `C`… no, no, no, no. Yeah, so this `s` means it indicates that if it’s a single bit, you can directly write `s`. But if it’s multiple bits, you have to use the `==` symbol. Okay, okay. Roshan, ma’am—is there any shortcut process, ma’am? Like, for an eight-to-one mux, it will be a lot more. An eight-to-one mux means three bits… Yeah, three bits again—you have to use conditional operators. One thing, yeah—it will be more complex, ma’am. Like, it will be linear. Instead of that, we can use a shorter process. For a shorter process, we will go for **behavioral modeling**, ma’am. Okay, okay. So, for that, sir, the levels of modeling have been increased one by one.  

In this, can you tell me if you can write flip-flop code here? Can you write a flip-flop code? Take a, yeah, ma’am. Thing? No, ma’am. Yeah, ma’am. So, it is difficult to write—it would be very lengthy, ma’am. Yeah, it would be, but we can write it now, ma’am. No, you need a clock here—you have to check with the clock. So, how will you check the data? We need an `initial` block, and you must use an `always` block. So... Always comes in a procedural block, so it is procedural. When you use `always`, know that it becomes your behavioral code. For clock generation, we also use `initial`, right? Yeah, I’ll show that in behavioral. Okay, okay, so we’ll finish up data flow, and then we’ll move to behavioral. Okay, ma’am. Okay, so I told you that you can use these bitwise operators, conditional operators, or arithmetic operators. The data flow modeling will be done using these operators. Okay, so next, we have behavioral. Do you want me to run this code in the tool, or will you do it? I’ll do it this time, ma’am. Okay, ma’am. Similarly, for... Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

For a full adder, you can also write equations for a ripple-carry adder. So, we’ll show that, ma’am. A ripple-carry adder means you’ll have three full adders, or you can directly write the equations for a ripple-carry adder. Ma’am, for a ripple-carry adder, can we directly write the equations using the `+` operator? Yes, it’s shown in the previous slides. No, yes, ma’am. That will become a seven-bit input, resulting in an eight-bit output, which is a ripple-carry adder. Yes, ma’am. So, this is a ripple-carry adder. No, so let me take only four bits. It’s having eight bits, so let me use `A3`, `A2`, `A1`, and `A0`. Then, I have `B3`, `B2`...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Here, I have `b1` and `b0`. Initially, you don't have any carry, so it will be `0`. Okay? So, by this, you'll get some `s0`. With this carry, you will propagate here. Again, you will get `s1`. This carry propagates here, and you'll get `s2`. This carry propagates here, and you'll get `s3`. The last bit, the extra bit you are taking now, will be `s4`. So, ripple carry can be written using these arithmetic operators. Is that okay? Understood? Yes, Ma'am. Yes, Ma'am. Yeah, so we'll go to behavioral modeling. Anyhow, you'll have assignments on this data flow. Okay, so... Modeling: Behavioral modeling is the highest level of abstraction. Okay, so here, you should know the truth table. If you know the truth table, you can easily implement whatever specification you have given, and you can capture it in the code. Okay. Here, you’ll be using the `always` block. Here, like this, you’ll be using this as an example of a 2-to-1 mux. So, in behavioral modeling, you will have an `always` block. Inside this, you’ll have conditional statements. Okay. So, this `always` block is also called a procedural block. `Initial` and `always` will come under procedural blocks.  

Till now, what we did: We saw assigned statements. We saw primitives using the primitive gates. Then, we saw primitive transistors, and using that, we did switch-level modeling. At the gate level, we did structural-level modeling. In data flow, we used the `assign` keyword. So, when we go to behavioral modeling, we have procedural blocks—that is, using… Always blocks and initial blocks are different. Usually, for the design, we don’t use initial blocks because initial blocks simulate only once—they don’t repeat. For that reason, we use initial blocks in the test bench, and we use always blocks in the design. There will be examples and discussions about initial and always blocks in the next sessions.  

In behavioral modeling, you’ll write using always blocks and conditional statements like `if-else` or `case` statements. In this example, I have a module with its name and ports, followed by port declarations. When you write behavioral modeling, you must declare signals as `reg` types—that’s fixed. So, in the data flow modeling, you are writing it as `assign`. Okay? Here, in the `assign` statement, you have to declare it as a `wire` in the data flow modeling. But in behavioral modeling, we have to write it differently—you declare it as a `reg` type. The output should be declared as a `reg` type.  

Inside this `always` block, we are assigning the `y` value. Okay? So, if you don’t declare it as a `reg` type, it will show an error like, “Procedural assignment is not allowed unless declared as a `reg` type.” It’s because it’s under a procedural block. Here, the `y` output value is being assigned inside the `always` block, which is a procedural block.  

So, you have the `always` keyword. This is the `@` operator. The `@` means it will wait until there is a change in these values. These values—whatever we call them—are called the **sensitivity list**. So, we call it as a... Sensitivity—okay. Sensitivity list—okay. When you’re writing this list, now here, the model depends on which inputs it depends. You have to write all the variables here. Okay? For a 2-to-1 mux, it will depend on `a`, `b`, and `s`. So, all the variables you have to define. If you miss even one value, it will give a simulation error. In the waveform, you’ll get different values.  

And this `always` block will be executed whenever there is a change in these variables. Initially, `a`, `b`, and `s` are the inputs, so what is the default value? It will be `wire` type, and it will have a `'Z'` (high impedance) value. Right? Once this value changes to something like `1'01` or `1'10`, then... This `always` block will get executed. So, again, inside this block, you will have an `if-else` or a `case` statement. Then, you have an `end` for this `always` block, and `end` for the entire module.  

If at all you miss one of these—okay, you will have only `a` and `b`. If you don’t give `s` in the `always` block, you consider `a` as `0` or `1`. Yes, initially, you have given `0`. Now, at the starting, there is a change in the `a` and `b` values, so it will enter and perform the operation.  

The next time, if you give `a` and `b` as the same value but change only the `s` value, that time—if you didn’t give `s` in the sensitivity list—it will not enter the `always` block. It will show the previous answer itself. So, for that sake, you have to give all the input ports on which the... The module will depend on what you have to view in the sensitivity list. So, the coding guidelines for Verilog when you go through behavioral modeling are that you have to include all the inputs in the sensitivity list. The sensitivity list must be complete. Okay? Have you understood this? Any doubts? Ma’am, why do we take a register type for the output, i.e., `always @ (reg)`? It’s because, in behavioral modeling, the value of `y` is not connected to any gates. We’re not using gates; we’re writing the logic using a truth table. Yes, ma’am. It is not driven by gates. So, we declared it as a… Here’s the corrected version of your text:

Regarding edge types, ma’am, we declare them in the design model only. Or, in any case, in the testbench, we declare outputs as `wire` types. Sir, in the testbench, there is no change, even for dataflow models. Dataflow models also have no change. Inputs will be declared as `reg` types, and outputs will be `wire` types. There is no change in the testbench; that is fixed. In the design, when you go to behavioral modeling, the output should be of a `reg` type. For other modeling styles, it will take the default, which is `wire`. Okay, okay. So, for this, we have a truth table where, if `Y` is `0`, I will get whatever is in `A`. If `Y` is `1`, I will get whatever is in `B`. So, for that purpose, I’m taking an `if` condition here. If `Y` is `1`...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Miss, since it is a single bit, I’m taking only the variable. Yes, if it is `1`, `y` will be `b`. Yes, `y` will be `a`. So, it is similar to your C programming `if-else` statement. Okay, so this is how we’ll be writing behavioral modeling. Any doubts? No, ma’am. Okay, so I will stop here. I will go to the tool, and I will show you what will happen if you miss any value inside it. Okay. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

Okay, I have that code. So, I will share the screen of that area in the playground. Okay, so I have a 2-to-1 MUX. The inputs are `A`, `B`, and `S`, and the output is `reg Y`. In the `always` block, I will initialize all the values. Okay, so if `S` is `1`, `Y` equals `B`; otherwise, `Y` equals `A`.

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

So, in the testbench, I have given some values for `A`, `B`, and `S`. Okay. After some time, I’m changing the `S` value. Okay. So, if I run this, okay, so here, `A` is `0`, `B` is `1`, and `S` is `1`. So, the output is whatever is in `B`. But when I see the next values, when `S` changes to `0`, why is it changing? Right? So, now, if at all I change the code, I will remove this `S`. Okay. So, I will run it. If I mistakenly forget to write the input...

--- 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments! In the sensitivity list, now you can see that for `s = 1`, I’m getting `y = 1`. For the next value, even if there is a change in the `yes` value, the output remains the same. Why? Because in the code, the `always` block is not depending on the `yes` value—it is only depending on the `a` and `b` values. Okay? This is incorrect. Right? So, for that reason, you always have to complete the sensitivity list. Okay? Have you understood this? Yes, ma’am. Yeah, ma’am. Okay. Something you had asked earlier? No, sorry. This `reg`… So, I will save it and run. So, it will show "y is not a valid left-hand side of the procedural assignment." Okay? This should be of a `reg` type because we are not using any gates to drive the `wire`. Right? Here, we are just using a truth table, and we are writing it. So, for that, we'll be declaring it as a `reg` type. Any doubts in today's session? So, we covered different types of operators, then we saw switch-level modeling, and we saw data-flow modeling. Okay? Now, in behavioral modeling, I gave just an introduction. In detail, we'll see it in tomorrow's class, Ma'am. In data-flow modeling, we always use `initial` and `always` blocks. In the test bench, you'll use `initial` in data-flow modeling. Sorry, `assign`—that's it. Okay? Then, I will show that code as well. I need to go back again, so let me take one example of data-flow modeling. Here, you have `assign` with the data-flow modeling of a half-adder that I have given. I have provided a single value of `a` and `b`, so when I run this... As I’m using a `display` statement, I will get the output here in the log file. So, `a` is `1`, `b` is `0`, `sum` is `1`, and `carry` is `0`. So, if at all you remove this part, okay—directly, if you do this—it will show an error: "Unexpected token," "Undefined module `b` was used," "Port connections rules will not be checked at such instance," and all those kinds of errors. You will be getting these errors. So, whenever you are using data flow modeling, you have to use the `assign` keyword. The testbench will remain the same for all the models. So, only in switch-level modeling do you not have any problems. Inputs will be `wire`, outputs will also… Be wired by default in gate-level modeling, and it remains the same when you go to data flow modeling. Outputs and inputs will remain as wire types. When you go to behavioral modeling, the output should be of a **register** type. Okay? Any doubts in today’s session? Please tick mark yes or no. Ma’am, yeah, ma’am. Suppose we are taking a full adder in the data flow model. So, in intermediate connections, everything should be mentioned as wire connections—wires. Okay? Yeah, wires. So, if you do any connection between the gates, no—that should be of a wire type. Even in behavioral modeling, if there are interconnections within the model, there is no concept of gates. Okay? Okay. Using a truth table directly, we’ll be writing the logic. Okay? Okay. So, I will stop here. So, yeah, the assignment is enabled—you can go to the assignments. The data flow modeling assignments are there. You can go through them and do it. You’ll have an assignment discussion of yesterday’s topic, which is gate-level and structural modeling. What time, ma’am? Timing? Four o’clock, okay, ma’am? Okay, ma’am. Four o’clock—Shilpa ma’am will be taking it. Not enabled, ma’am. Ma’am, will the RTL design PPT be available? I will check. I have given whether it is enabled or not—I will check and tell you. Okay? Okay, ma’am. It is already uploaded. Whether it is enabled or not, I will ask and confirm. Okay, so the data is not enabled yet, Ma'am. The data assignment is not enabled. The PPTs are available—the RTL PDF is available. Yes, Ma'am. The RTL PDF is available. It is available. Yeah, okay. So, I will ask for the data assignment to be enabled. I'll ask them once again. Well, we are using the same PDF for the 380 AD, right? The 380 AD is there, so the extra things are added for the 80. Then, you must have the ADIDS PDF. Is the PDF enabled, or no? I don't think so. The ADIDS PDF is there—it is enabled, Ma'am. The RTL PDF is enabled. It's the same thing that you use. Here’s the corrected version of your text:

---

No, it’s not `pre_add`. It’s `add`, because for `add`, at the end, I have added tasks and functions. No, ma’am, it’s not available, ma’am. It’s not there. No, ma’am. Okay, I will upload it, and I will ask them to enable it. Okay, ma’am. Assignment means RTL assignment—we will discuss this with Shilpa ma’am. Yeah, Shilpa ma’am will be discussing it because I have some extra classes today. Okay, okay, ma’am. Okay, ma’am. So, if there are any doubts, we can discuss them again on Monday. I will take a discussion session on Monday. Okay, okay. That time, if there are any doubts, we can discuss them on Monday afternoon. Okay, ma’am. Okay. So, today, Shilpa ma’am will be taking the session in the afternoon. Meet at 4 o’clock. Okay.
