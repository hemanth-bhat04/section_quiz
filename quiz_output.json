            "content": "**Question 1:**\n\nIn the context of reinforcement learning, what is the role of a Markov Decision Process (MDP)?\n\nA) To model non-deterministic environments with partial observability\nB) To define the optimal policy without considering the reward function\nC) To model sequential decision-making problems where the current state depends only on the previous state and action\nD) To predict the next state of a system without considering the reward or punishment\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Answer: C</summary>\n  <p>C. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to model sequential decision-making problems where the current state depends only on the previous state and the action taken, which aligns with the \"current state movements\" and \"markov decision processes\" keywords. Option A is incorrect because MDPs can model both deterministic and non-deterministic environments with full or partial observability. Option B is incorrect because the optimal policy is derived considering the reward function. Option D is incorrect as MDPs are designed to model systems where the next state is influenced by the current state and the action taken, and this involves the consideration of rewards.</p>\n</details>\n\nType: Single\nKeywords: markov decision processes\nDifficulty: L2\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nWhich of the following best describes the purpose of an optimal policy reward function in reinforcement learning?\n\nA) To provide a direct measure of the performance of an agent in a given environment\nB) To determine the next state of the system without considering the current state\nC) To guide the agent's decision-making process by assigning values to different actions in each state\nD) To predict future states without considering the current state or the actions taken\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Answer: C</summary>\n  <p>C. The optimal policy reward function assigns values to different actions in each state to guide the agent's decision-making process, aligning with \"optimal policy reward functions.\" Option A is incorrect because while it's related to performance, it is not the direct purpose of the reward function. Option B is incorrect because the reward function does not directly determine the next state; that is the role of the environment. Option D is incorrect because the reward function, while considering future states, does so in the context of the current state and actions taken.</p>\n</details>\n\nType: Single\nKeywords: optimal policy reward functions\nDifficulty: L2\n\n**Question 3:**\n\nIn the context of reinforcement learning, how does an agent iterate through the learning process?\n\nA) By continuously updating its policy based on the reward received from the environment\nB) By randomly selecting actions without considering the current state or reward\nC) By learning the optimal policy directly from the reward function without exploring the environment\nD) By using a pre-defined set of actions that do not change over time\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Answer: A</summary>\n  <p>A. An agent iterates through the learning process by continuously updating its policy based on the reward received from the environment, aligning with \"agent iteration.\" Option B is incorrect because it suggests a random action selection without strategic learning. Option C is incorrect because learning the optimal policy requires both reward feedback and exploration. Option D is incorrect because it describes a fixed policy, which is not characteristic of iterative learning in reinforcement learning.</p>\n</details>\n\nType: Single\nKeywords: agent iteration\nDifficulty: L2"
